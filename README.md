# Final-Project

The purpose of this project is to chart the population of insects over a certain period compared to temperatures.  We’re looking to see if the temperatures from 1992 to 2009 have an impact on the insect population and if global warming plays a part.  We will also use this data to predict future results.  The reason why we selected the topic is because we’re trying to track the future population of insects and one of the members of the group is very interested in insects.
